# OLA-booking-Analysis

Just Completed a Full Data Analytics Project (Excel + SQL + Power BI)

I recently completed a data analytics project where I applied three key skills—Excel, SQL, and Power BI—to analyze a real-world bookings dataset (one month OLA Bookings in Bangalore). With experience in aviation operations and a growing interest in data, this project helped me strengthen my analytical capabilities and transition further into the data domain.
Using the raw dataset, I explored booking patterns, customer behavior, and ride performance by writing SQL queries and Created Power BI Dashboard to answers important business questions and understanding business different patterns. 

Some of the key tasks I performed include:

SQL Questions:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings:
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type:
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers:
4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides:
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues:
6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings:
7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI:
8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type:
9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully:
10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason:

Power BI Questions:
1. Ride Volume Over Time
2. Booking Status Breakdown
3. Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance
4. Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type
5. cancelled Rides Reasons
6. Revenue by Payment Method
7. Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value
8. Ride Distance Distribution Per Day
9. Driver Ratings Distribution
10. Customer vs. Driver Ratings

Tools used:
 • Excel for data cleaning and initial exploration
 • SQL for detailed analysis and query-based insights
 • Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation

This project helped me apply analytical thinking, understand data workflows end-to-end, and improve my confidence in working with structured dataset.
